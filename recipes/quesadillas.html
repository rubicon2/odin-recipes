    <h1>Golden Lentil Quesadillas</h1>
    <img src="../img/quesadillas.jpg", alt="A plateful of outrageously crispy quesadillas.", height=400/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These quesadillas have the perfect blend of spice and gooey cheese.</p>
    <p>You can use any kind of beans to make these although my favourite filling is with brown lentils.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flatbreads</li>
        <li>
            Filling: 
            <ul>
                <li>Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
                <li>Brown lentils</li>
                <li>Red onion</li>
                <li>Sweetcorn</li>
                <li>Minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Spice mix (makes enough for 1lb of meat or 3 cups of legumes):
            <ul>
                <li>Chilli powder, 1 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Smoked paprika, 1 tsp</li>
                <li>Cayenne chilli powder, 1/4 tsp</li>
                <li>Oregano, 1/2 tsp</li>
                <li>Cumin, 1 tsp</li>
                <li>Cracked black pepper, 1/2 tsp</li>
                <li>Salt, 1/2 tsp</li>
                <li>Cornflour, 1/2 tsp (to prevent filling sogging anything up)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix up the spice mix ingredients in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Chop the onions and garlic and add to a large mixing bowl. Here's a tip: if you're sick of struggling to remove the skin from garlic cloves, try crushing the garlic with a sturdy knife before chopping it up. That skin'll come right off.</li>
        <li>Drain the lentils or beans, and rinse them off with cold water.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining filling ingredients to the mixing bowl. Add the spices and mix well. </li>
        <li>Fill half of each flatbread with the mix and fold in half.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat a pan with some olive oil and fry the quesadillas on a medium low heat. We want the cheese to melt in the middle without the outsides getting burnt!</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to periodically check the underside. Flip once it looks golden, crispy and tasty.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat if the filling doesn't look melted enough already. If the cheese isn't all gooey on the inside, it's not going to be a great quesadilla!</li>
        <li>Once golden and crispy on both sides and the cheese has melted, remove from the pan and place on a napkin to soak up any excess oil. This means it will stay crispy for longer - good if you are a slow eater like myself.</li>
        <li>Try serving with some kind of dip - sour cream or guacamole works!</li>
    </ol>
