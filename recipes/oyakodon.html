    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A bowl of fresh rice topped with tender chicken chunks and onions, 
        simmered in a delicious dashi broth and topped with egg and spring onions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is easy and quick to make and is a great example of the unique 
        combination of sweet and savoury that is typical of Japanese cuisine.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 portion of chicken (thighs are traditional, although I prefer breast meat)</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion</li>
        <li>A couple of thinly sliced spring onions, to garnish</li>
        <li>A bowl of cooked rice</li>
        <li>
            Soup ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Instant dashi powder, 1/3 a sachet</li>
                <li>Sake, 2 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Soy sauce (kikkoman is best), 2 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Mirin (if unavailable, substitute with extra brown sugar), 1 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Brown sugar, 1/2 Tbsp</li>
                <li>Water, 1 Tbsp</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't cooked rice already, put some on now. It will probably be done by the time you are finished making the oyakodon.</li>
        <li>Mix up the soup ingredients in a jug.</li>
        <li>Prepare the other ingredients - cut up the onion, spring onions and chicken.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and chicken to a saucepan, and add the soup.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil and then reduce to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked through, crack an egg or two on top. Add the saucepan lid to steam the egg.</li>
        <li>Once the egg is cooked to your preference, get a bowl of rice and top with the finished oyakodon.</li>
        <li>Top with the thinly sliced spring onions.</li>
        <li>Scoff!</li>
    </ol>
